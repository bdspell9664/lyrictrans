[00:16.00]I can't believe it's over
[00:20.00]I watched the whole thing fall
[00:24.00]And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
[00:32.00]If I'd only known
[00:36.00]The days were slipping past
[00:40.00]That the good things never last
[00:44.00]That you were crying
[00:48.00]Summer turned to winter
[00:52.00]And the snow it turned to rain
[00:56.00]And the rain turned into tears upon your face
[01:04.00]I hardly recognized the girl you are today
[01:12.00]And God I hope it's not too late
[01:16.00]It's not too late
[01:20.00]
[01:24.00]'Cause you're the one
[01:28.00]You're the one
[01:32.00]Who can make moments last forever
[01:40.00]And you're the one
[01:44.00]You're the one
[01:48.00]Who can make my dreams come true
[01:56.00]You're the one
[02:00.00]You're the one
[02:04.00]You're my everything
[02:12.00]
[02:16.00]I can't believe it's over
[02:20.00]I watched the whole thing fall
[02:24.00]And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
[02:32.00]If I'd only known
[02:36.00]The days were slipping past
[02:40.00]That the good things never last
[02:44.00]That you were crying
[02:48.00]
[02:52.00]Summer turned to winter
[02:56.00]And the snow it turned to rain
[03:00.00]And the rain turned into tears upon your face
[03:08.00]I hardly recognized the girl you are today
[03:16.00]And God I hope it's not too late
[03:20.00]It's not too late
[03:24.00]
[03:28.00]'Cause you're the one
[03:32.00]You're the one
[03:36.00]Who can make moments last forever
[03:44.00]And you're the one
[03:48.00]You're the one
[03:52.00]Who can make my dreams come true
[04:00.00]You're the one
[04:04.00]You're the one
[04:08.00]You're my everything
[04:16.00]
[04:20.00]You're the one
[04:24.00]You're the one
